# Missing authentication controllers for Laravel Passport

## ***It is just early stage to share it with community but any one welcome to test it.***

### ***What is Passcon?***

Passcon just a package wich contain simple authentication controllers for Laravel Passport. Its including E-mail verifications features and sample views for password reset forms.

### ***Why is Passcon?***

Created only and really for my personal need. I wanted to use Passport and at that point i had to create a scaffold which Laravel is not providing as a starter kit. So, naturally this package was created to work get done. And i publish Passcon as a public package just because of i did not seen anybody published yet.

### ***Who is Passcon for?***

If you wanted to use passport but have any hestitate, then clone this repository and get start on project.

### ***Why not just using Laravel Sanctum?***

It is a good question and i would use it if it could work with Safari browser too. But currently there is not any solution or effort to complability for Safari. Also, may Sanctum seems like equal with Passport for now but i am hoping serve api for 3th parties for future and they will not seems same at that point.

### ***Versioning***

Created using by Laravel version 8 with Passport version 10 and not tested with any other version yet.
